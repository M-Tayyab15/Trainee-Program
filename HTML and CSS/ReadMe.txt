# README

Welcome to my training project repository! Over the course of **15 days**, I dedicated my time to honing my skills through a variety of tasks and designs. This repository includes:

### Key Features

#### Main Designs
I created **3 standout designs** that showcase my learning progress and creativity during this training:

- **figmaAiLayout**: Located in the **day6** folder.
- **aiWidth**: Found in the **day7** folder.
- **realestateAI**: Available in the **day9** folder.
  
Additionally, my **final task**, which is fully responsive, can be found in the **task** folder. 

**Note**: To fully experience the designs, please use a live server, as the file paths are a combination of relative and absolute links.

#### Daily Tasks
Throughout the training, I completed a series of smaller tasks each day to reinforce my skills and explore different techniques. 

- **day1/**, **day2/**, ..., **day15/**: Each folder contains various small tasks and projects completed on that specific day, including sketches, prototypes, and other practice exercises.
